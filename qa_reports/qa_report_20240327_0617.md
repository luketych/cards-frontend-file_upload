# QA Test Report - March 27, 2024

## Environment Setup Issues

### 1. React Development Server Launch Problems
**Issue**: Unable to start the React development server from the root directory
**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Navigate to `/Users/luketych/Dev/_projects/_cards/frontend/viscera`
2. Run `npm start`
**Expected**: React development server should start
**Actual**: Error message: "Could not read package.json: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/luketych/package.json'"
**Root Cause**: Command being executed from wrong directory. Need to be in `react_version` directory.

### 2. Port Conflict
**Issue**: Port 3000 already in use
**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Kill existing process on port 3000
2. Try to start React server again
**Expected**: Server should start on port 3000
**Actual**: Prompt asking to use different port
**Note**: This is expected behavior but should be documented

## Application Functionality Issues

### 1. Molecule Creation/Editing State Management
**Issue**: Creating new molecule shows data from existing molecule
**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Open application
2. Create a new molecule with some data
3. Close the modal
4. Click "Create Molecule" again
**Expected**: Empty form with no pre-filled data
**Actual**: Form shows data from previously created molecule
**Root Cause**: State not being properly reset in MoleculeModal component

### 2. Molecule Editing
**Issue**: Editing wrong molecule
**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Create multiple molecules
2. Click edit on a specific molecule
**Expected**: Form should show data for selected molecule
**Actual**: Form shows data for a different molecule
**Root Cause**: State management issue in MoleculeModal component

### 3. Unused Function Warning
**Issue**: ESLint warning about unused function
**Location**: `src/App.tsx` line 51
**Warning**: "'handleDeleteMolecule' is assigned a value but never used"
**Impact**: No functional impact, but indicates incomplete feature implementation

## Component-Specific Issues

### MoleculeModal Component
1. **State Reset Timing**:
   - State reset happens on modal close but not properly on new creation
   - Need to ensure state is reset when switching between create/edit modes

2. **File Processing**:
   - Processing state not properly cleared in all scenarios
   - Could lead to UI showing incorrect processing status

3. **Validation**:
   - Form validation exists but error messages could be more user-friendly
   - No visual indication of required fields until submission attempt

## Browser Compatibility
- Tested on Chrome
- Need to verify behavior on other browsers (Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Performance Considerations
1. File processing could be optimized for large files
2. Multiple file uploads might need progress indication
3. State updates during file processing could be more efficient

## Recommendations
1. Implement proper state reset in MoleculeModal component
2. Add visual indicators for required fields
3. Implement proper error handling for file processing
4. Add loading states for better UX
5. Consider implementing file upload progress indicators
6. Add browser compatibility testing
7. Implement the delete functionality or remove unused code

## Next Steps
1. Fix state management issues in MoleculeModal
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Add loading states
4. Test on multiple browsers
5. Implement delete functionality or clean up unused code
